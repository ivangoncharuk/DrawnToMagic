# Drawn To Magic

## Description

Drawn to Magic is an open-world RPG that allows you to interact with the world through gestures. The game's primary focus is create a fun environment where you can play the game for hours exploring the world.

Interact with a diverse cast of characters ranging from friendly allies to hostile enemies and influence their behavior and attitude towards you. The unique gesture-based spellcasting system requires skill and timing [(#1)](/../../issues/1), adding an extra layer of excitement and challenge to the gameplay.

## New ideas

Glyph Fusion: In this system, players can merge glyphs to create new ones with combined effects. For instance, fusing a fire glyph with a wind glyph might create a firestorm effect. To balance this feature, make fusion a rare or costly process, requiring specific items or resources, or limit the number of fused glyphs a player can hold.

Environmental Interactions: Design glyphs that interact with the game world, adding depth and strategy. For example, a water manipulation glyph could extinguish fires, create temporary bridges, or solve puzzles. Consider creating environmental challenges that require clever use of these glyphs to progress.

Time-limited Glyphs: Introduce powerful but temporary glyphs obtained through quests, events, or rare drops. These glyphs might grant extraordinary abilities, such as invincibility or massive damage output, but only last for a short period or have limited uses. This adds excitement and variety to gameplay while maintaining balance.

Cooperative Spellcasting: In a multiplayer setting, players can work together to create more potent spells. For example, one player could cast an ice glyph, while another casts a lightning glyph, creating a powerful ice-lightning combo. Encourage cooperation by designing challenges and boss fights that are more easily overcome with coordinated spellcasting.

Glyph Evolution: As players level up or progress, their glyphs could evolve, becoming more potent or gaining new abilities. This can be a separate progression system, with glyphs leveling up based on usage or through specific items. Evolution could also be tied to player choices, allowing them to guide the development of their glyphs.

Spellcasting Challenges: Integrate challenges that test players' glyph-drawing skills. These could include time-limited challenges, precision tests, or puzzles that require specific glyph combinations. Players who complete these challenges can earn rewards such as new glyphs, resources, or unique items.

New Fresh Insights:

Glyph Mastery: Introduce a mastery system where players can improve their proficiency with specific glyphs, leading to reduced casting time, increased power, or additional effects. Mastery can be gained through repeated usage or completing challenges related to a particular glyph.

Elemental Affinities: Incorporate an elemental affinity system where players, enemies, and environments have strengths and weaknesses tied to certain elements. This encourages strategic use of glyphs and can create dynamic and engaging encounters.

Hidden Glyphs: Hide secret glyphs throughout the game world, rewarding exploration and curiosity. These glyphs could have unique effects or unlock hidden areas and content.

Glyph Customization: Allow players to personalize their glyphs with cosmetic enhancements, such as unique visual effects, colors, or animations. This can create a sense of ownership and pride in their spellcasting abilities.

Inspirations for Glyphs:

Chinese Characters: Draw inspiration from the complex and meaningful structure of Chinese characters, which could translate well into a glyph-based system. Japanese Kanji: Similar to Chinese characters, Japanese kanji offer a rich visual language that can inspire the creation of interesting and engaging glyphs. Hieroglyphics: Ancient Egyptian hieroglyphics provide a unique and visually striking basis for a glyph system. Runes: Norse or Anglo-Saxon runes have a distinct appearance and historical context that can serve as an interesting foundation for your glyphs. Alchemical Symbols: Draw from historical alchemical symbols, which are often simple yet meaningful, and can fit well within a magic-based game. Chronological Task Focus for a Playable Demo:

Define the game world and setting. Develop a balanced spell system with basic glyphs and their effects. Design the tutorial system to teach players the core mechanics. Implement basic environmental interactions for a more immersive experience. Create a few simple puzzles and obstacles
